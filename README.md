Breast Cancer Diagnosis App
The Breast Cancer Diagnosis App is a machine learning-powered tool built to aid medical professionals and students in the early detection and diagnosis of breast cancer. By using a sophisticated prediction model, the app analyzes specific measurements of a breast mass and provides insights on its likelihood of being benign or malignant.

🩺 Key Features
Accurate Diagnosis Prediction: Using a machine learning algorithm trained on relevant medical data, the app predicts the probability of a breast mass being benign or malignant.
Visual Insights: View a radar chart representation of the input data for a clear and intuitive visual assessment.
Flexible Data Input:
Manually input measurements for analysis, ideal for quick assessments.
Connect directly to a cytology lab for automated data retrieval (Note: machine integration is external to the app).
⚙️ How It Works
Input the Data: The user enters measurements associated with the breast mass, such as radius, texture, perimeter, and other specific attributes.
Run Prediction: The app processes these inputs through its trained model and predicts the diagnosis as either Benign or Malignant.
View Results: The predicted diagnosis and probability scores are displayed, providing a quick and data-driven assessment.
📊 Visual Representation
A radar chart offers a comprehensive view of the input data, highlighting how different measurements compare to typical benign or malignant cases. This visual aid enhances the app's usability, helping medical professionals make informed assessments.
